### Why Software development, and why Information Systems?

I chose the software development career because I feel that in our increasingly digital age, our present and future are largely influenced by software[*](/posts/about/). Alternatively, I aspire to be a technical-oriented business analyst who can enhance business processes with the advantage of in-depth IT knowledge.

I enjoy the creative process behind software creation: creating visually-appealing UI and generating the best user experience on the front end, and the satisfying puzzle-solving nature of the back end. With Information Systems, analysing and enhancing business processes also creates creative, puzzle-solving challenges that I enjoy.

### What are my hobbies?

- Drawing - Traditional and Digital
- Needle Felting
- Video games - I enjoy Minecraft, Sims 4, some automation games like Dyson Sphere Program, Satisfactory, and Factorio 

### What am I studying?

I am currently 3/4 years into the [Bachelor of Business and Bachelor of Computer and Information Sciences Conjoint Programme](https://www.aut.ac.nz/courses/bachelor-of-business-and-bachelor-of-computer-and-information-sciences-conjoint?source=/business) (BBus/BCIS) at Auckland University of Technology. My majors are [Information Systems (BBus)](https://www.aut.ac.nz/study/study-options/business/courses/bachelor-of-business/business-information-systems-major) and [Software Development (BCIS)](https://www.aut.ac.nz/study/study-options/engineering-computer-and-mathematical-sciences/courses/bachelor-of-computer-and-information-sciences/software-development-major).

#### Current papers (As of Semester 2, 2024)

At the moment, I am learning about Operating Systems (COMP604), which I am excited or as I will be learning how computers really work behind the scenes, and will be learning Linux. I hope to become a better developer who makes better design decisions after this infamously challenging paper.

Additionally, I am currently taking Data Mining and Knowledge Engineering (COMP723), a paper that will teach me data mining techniques hands-on for a variety of applications, including machine learning.

I will be delving into Designing Systems for Contemporary Enterprises (BSYS706), where I will be in a software development team developing a business solution using a low-code platform called Mendix.

Finally, with Digital Transformation and Social Impact (BSYS705), I will be looking into how a emerging digital technologies drive transformation in businesses, industries and society.

At the moment, I am learning data structures and algorithms (COMP610), a crucial toolkit every software developer must learn.

Additionally, I am currently taking Software Development Practice (COMP602), a paper that emphasizes the Agile methodology and the Scrum framework. I will be undertaking Android app development for the first time.

I will be delving into Python for a business paper (BUSS511), learning how to utilize Pandas, and to program for business analytics.

Additionally, I will be visiting R Studio and R in another business paper to learn how to manage business data for analytics (BUSS613).
