### Why Software development, and why Information Systems?

I chose the software development career because I feel that in our increasingly digital age, our present and future are largely influenced by software[*](/posts/about/). In conjunction, I aspire to be a business analyst who can enhance business processes with the advantage of in-depth IT knowledge.

I enjoy the creative process behind software creation: creating visually-appealing UI and generating the best user experience on the front end, and the satisfying puzzle-solving nature of the back end. Enhancing business processes evokes the same creative puzzle-solving challenges that I enjoy.

I would consider myself a jack-of-all-trades. I am creatively oriented, and I enjoy the challenge of solving programming problems. As well as being well-accustomed to computers, I am also familiarized with the business process and solving business problems.

### What are my hobbies?

- Drawing - Traditional and Digital
- Video games - I am currently enjoying Baldur's Gate
- Practicing guitar (I'm not very good yet) and the penny whistle (slightly better, but still not great)

### What am I studying?

I am currently 3/4 years into the [Bachelor of Business and Bachelor of Computer and Information Sciences Conjoint Programme](https://www.aut.ac.nz/courses/bachelor-of-business-and-bachelor-of-computer-and-information-sciences-conjoint?source=/business) (BBus/BCIS) at Auckland University of Technology. My majors are [Information Systems (BBus)](https://www.aut.ac.nz/study/study-options/business/courses/bachelor-of-business/business-information-systems-major) and [Software Development (BCIS)](https://www.aut.ac.nz/study/study-options/engineering-computer-and-mathematical-sciences/courses/bachelor-of-computer-and-information-sciences/software-development-major).

#### Current papers

At the moment, I am learning data structures and algorithms (COMP610), a crucial toolkit every software developer must learn.

Additionally, I am currently taking Software Development Practice (COMP602), a paper that emphasizes the Agile methodology and the Scrum framework. I will be undertaking Android app development for the first time.

I will be delving into Python for a business paper (BUSS511), learning how to utilize Pandas, and to program for business analytics.

Additionally, I will be visiting R Studio and R in another business paper to learn how to manage business data for analytics (BUSS613).
