This was a 2021 high school project for [NCEA Achievement Standard AS91906: Use complex programming techniques to develop a computer program](https://www.nzqa.govt.nz/nqfdocs/ncea-resource/achievements/2019/as91906.pdf). I received an Excellence on this project.

The project involved developing a Python GUI Math Practice game (using TKinter) for primary school students to use.

  1. The user enters their name and age on the front page
  2. The user can choose the operation type: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division
  3. The user can also choose the difficulty: Easy, Intermediate, Hard
  4. The user answers a series of 10 math questions, after each, it is shown whether the answer is incorrect/correct
  5. After answering, the user can view all correct answers
  6. The user can appear on a 5-place leaderboard
  7. The user can then Retry/Log out

- User information (including past performance for the leaderboard) is recorded on txt files

This was my first software project using object-oriented programming and GUI, so its  not the prettiest!
