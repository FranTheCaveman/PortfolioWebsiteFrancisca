In high school, I completely pursued the sciences because I was thinking of becoming a biomedical engineer. On the side, I took design as it was my passion - I loved drawing characters and I was excited about animation.

In my first year, I took the computer science course out of the interest of potentially making games, and because I was familiarised with computers and wanted to get better. I found it challenging and dropped it in my second year.

In my 3rd year, I drifted away from my interest in the Sciences, and went down the route of design. Although it was recommended to take 3rd year computer science if 2nd year computer science was taken, I gave it another go with the same motivations I had in my 1st year.

I ended up enjoying computer science. I had to teach myself what I didn't learn in my 2nd year, and in the process, I became excited about the final assignment, which involved developing a Python GUI math practice game for the neighbouring primary school. My math quiz program ended up becoming one of the best in the class with a top grade!
