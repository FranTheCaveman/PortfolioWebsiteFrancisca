**You can find the project on Github [here](https://github.com/yashsavani19/FoodieBuddy)**

Foodie Buddy was a team effort that involved designing and developing a platform for users to search for nearby food places - within 2 Agile Scrum Sprints. Foodie Buddy was developed in React Native with Typescript. We used OpenAI for AI chatbot capabilities and Google API (Maps, Places) for nearby search and map features. My role was the Product Owner, which I was assigned through coming up with the initial idea of the app.

**Features include:**

- A Login/Register system
- Nearby restauarants with searching and filtering
- Ability to Mark restauarants as Bookmarked, Favorited, or Visited
- Add Friends
- Create friend chats and group chats
- Add food preferences to your profile (ex. American, Burger, Vegan)
- An AI Chatbot that uses results from Google Places nearby search to recommend restaurants according to the user's food preferences
- AI Chatbot integration in friend group chats, which recommends nearby restauarants according to the chat history
- And more!
  
**I worked on:**

- The entire UX/UI design including the logo using Figma and Adobe Illustrator
- Editing of the Sprint 1 video using Adobe Premiere and Canva
- Frontend:
  - Home page (restaurant listings)
  - Filter drawer
  - Components of the details page such as opening and closing times over the week
- Backend functionality:
  - Fetching of appropriate restaurant details through the Google Places (new) API
  - Filtering and refining of restaurants (categories) using Google's place types
  - Range adjustment affecting the available restaurants listed in the home page
- Bug fixes and touch-ups in other user stories
