Shareversity was a collaborative project that involved designing a hypothetical shares trading platform

- Share prices over time are randomly generated
- You can buy shares from a selected date, then sell these shares with its value relative to its cost per share in the present

Features include:

- Implementation of a graphical user interface
- Wallet topup and withdraw system
- The Purchasing of shares (high and low risk)
- Displaying interactive graphs: clicking a date selects the day the user wants to invest
- A Login system
- A portfolio page displaying the user's current investments and investment statistics
- An Investment page displaying investments avaliable to the user, with information provided for each
- A local database storing usernames, passwords, wallet, and portfolio information

We developed the UI and simulated the UX using Figma, you can find the mockup [here](https://www.figma.com/file/zDuDULdOC8Yqa6uG25QvOX/Assignment-1-Part-2?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=3MTgVN6UwySyocKh-1)
