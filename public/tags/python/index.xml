      <description>This was a 2021 high school project for NCEA Achievement Standard AS91906: Use complex programming techniques to develop a computer program. I received an Excellence on this project.&#xA;The project involved developing a Python GUI Math Practice game (using TKinter) for primary school students to use.&#xA;The user enters their name and age on the front page The user can choose the operation type: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division The user can also choose the difficulty: Easy, Intermediate, Hard The user answers a series of 10 math questions, after each, it is shown whether the answer is incorrect/correct After answering, the user can view all correct answers The user can appear on a 5-place leaderboard The user can then Retry/Log out User information (including past performance for the leaderboard) is recorded on txt files This was my first software project using object-oriented programming and GUI, so its not the prettiest!</description>
